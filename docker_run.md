# SubGame Network

## Run in Docker

First, install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and
[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

Download [newFork.zip](https://document.subgame.org/newFork.zip) and unzip get file `newFork.json`

Then run the following command to start a single node chain.

```bash
docker-compose up
```

> This command will firstly compile your code, and then start a network. You can
also replace the default command by appending your own. A few useful ones are as follow.

With this command, you should see something like this if your node is running successfully:

If the number after `finalized:` is increasing, your blockchain is producing new blocks and reaching
consensus about the state they describe!

> While not critical now, please do read all the startup logs for your node, as they help inform you
> of key configuration information as you continue to learn and move past these first basic tutorials.

## Start the Front-End Template

To interact with your local node, we will use
[the Substrate Developer Hub Front-End Template](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-front-end-template),
which is a collection of UI components that have been designed with common use cases in mind.

> Be sure to use the correct version of the template for the version of substrate you are using
> as [major versions](https://semver.org/) are _not_ expected to be interoperable!

You already installed the Front-End Template; let's launch it by executing the following command
in the root directory of the Front-End Template:

```bash
# Make sure to run this command in the root directory of the Front-End Template
yarn start
```

## Interact

Once the Front-End Template is running and loaded in your browser at
[http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/), take a moment to explore its components. At the
top, you will find lots of helpful information about the chain to which you're connected as well as
an account selector that will let you control the account you use to perform on-chain operations.
